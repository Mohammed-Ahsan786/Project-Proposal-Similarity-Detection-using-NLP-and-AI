A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews with participants aged 13 to 18. The survey assessed daily screen time, types of social media usage, and self-reported mental health indicators. Interviews provided deeper insights into personal experiences and perceptions regarding social media's impact. Results revealed a correlation between excessive screen time and increased feelings of anxiety and loneliness, particularly among users who reported negative interactions online. Conversely, participants who engaged in positive online communities reported higher levels of social support and lower anxiety. This study underscores the complex role of social media in adolescent mental health, highlighting the need for balanced usage and promoting healthy online interactions. The findings contribute to ongoing discussions about digital well-being and provide valuable insights for parents, educators, and mental health professionals.\"\"\"\n",
