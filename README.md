# Project Proposal Similarity Detection using NLP and AI

> **Abstract** : In this project student has to find the similarity in the submitted projects by students on the Title and Abstract. The students submit their project ideas to the system. The system then check the title and abstract with previously submitted projects in the system. The main aim of the project is to avoid repetition of the projects. Based on the set threshold the system should automatically reject the proposal if there is high similarity with any of the previous projects. As a future scope this project maybe extented to the patent application process to make the patent application process efficient.
